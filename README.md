# Chinese Counties: Geographic Determinants

Materials for my MA thesis at Fudan University (复旦大学)

The idea is to find why some parts of China have lots of counties, and others don't
<br>To do this I'm using geographic data from ArcGIS, such as land elevation & agricultural productivity
<br>Then I'll use regression analysis with Python to determine how these geographic factors influence county density

The motivation is that counties compete with one another for firm investment through their economic policies
<br>The more counties in an area, the fiercer competition is — so county density helps explain policy choices
<br>Thus, this study will help researchers use geographic data as an instrumental variable for county density
